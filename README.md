## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is the profile repo of a student trying to make cool projects in their final year of College. 
Currently, I'm working on 4 primary projects as of this commit:
  1. Dark Money - A hybrid card game / app themed around finance and specifically [Dark Pools]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pool)). 
  2. A research paper in colloboration with a Professor on the relationship between natural disasters and innovation (measured in patents output by firms).
  3. Web development for my student governments website.
  4. Blogging my interests and minor projects both for the public to see and to save on space in my memory!
